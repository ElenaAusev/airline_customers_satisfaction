# Project introduction:
Data for this project was taken from www.mavenanalytics.com page. The topic - Airline passenger satisfaction. I choose five questions to analyze this data and answers are shown by creating various graphs.

# Project progress:
Check the data to see if there is any discrepancies or unequality.

# Questions:
#### 1. Analyze passegers count by their age and gender.
   First, I categorized passengers into age groups and then created a pie chart.

I went further and analyzed how many people by age and gender are in different types of cabin class - business, economy and economy plus.

Then separated only least (in-flight WiFi service) and most (in-flight service) voted service.

Created the catagories of satisfaction level according to the vote score. And showed it in the chart.

#### 3. How does the score changes according to a different cabin?
I have found out how many people travel in each cabin class.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/246dbb2e-d9cd-4101-90bc-6fce35c9c5aa)

Then found out what is the different between the travellers by age and gender in each cabin. The results show that it is very equal distribution.

Then I analyzed the average score by service in different cabins. 
Business class:

Economy plus class cabin:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34c6e097-86d6-49a8-a745-77d7f10db898)

When comparing all the cabin class average scores, there is not much difference.

#### 4. How does the score changed according to the flight duration?
I made an additional column to categorize each passenger by what type of flight he had according to the miles flown. And the showed it in a pie chart to see who which type of flight was flown the most. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c545496-5a89-4ef4-a9f3-3aa4964a7a0c)

And then I found out the average score of service depending of flight duration. 
Very short flights:

Short flights:

Average lenght:

Long flights:

And here we can see the chart by an avergae score on each tyoe of flight by duration
