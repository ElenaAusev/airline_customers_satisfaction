Project introduction:
Data for this project was taken from www.mavenanalytics.com page. The topic - Airline passenger satisfaction. I choose five questions to analyze this data and answers are shown by creating various graphs.

Project progress:
Check the data to see if there is any discrepancies or unequality.

Questions:
1. Analyze passegers count by their age and gender.
